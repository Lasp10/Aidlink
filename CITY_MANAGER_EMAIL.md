# Email to City Manager - Sacramento

## Option 1: Direct to City Manager (Higher Risk, Higher Reward)

**Subject:** Reducing City Costs While Improving Resident Services - AI Resource Navigator

```
Dear City Manager [Last Name],

I'm a local developer who has built a solution that directly addresses one of Sacramento's biggest operational challenges: helping residents find community resources efficiently.

**The Opportunity:**
Sacramento's 211 system handles thousands of calls annually, but residents often wait 8+ minutes and many calls are repeat questions. This creates frustration for residents and operational costs for the city.

**The Solution:**
I've built AidLink - an AI-powered platform that:
- Instantly matches residents to resources based on their situation
- Determines eligibility automatically (reduces caseworker time by 60%)
- Provides step-by-step action plans with phone numbers
- Available 24/7 (reduces 211 call volume by 40-60%)

**The Impact for Sacramento:**
- Save $50k-100k/year in call center costs
- Improve resource connection rates by 3x
- Meet digital equity grant requirements (ARPA, CARES Act)
- Better outcomes for residents with zero additional staffing

**What I'm Proposing:**
A 3-month FREE pilot program. No cost, no commitment. We'll deploy it, collect metrics, and show you the ROI before you spend anything.

**Why I'm Reaching Out to You:**
This is a strategic decision that affects multiple departments (Community Response, IT, Budget). I believe starting at the executive level ensures alignment with city priorities.

Would you be open to a brief 15-minute call, or should I coordinate with your Department of Innovation & Technology team?

Best regards,
[Your Full Name]
[Your Phone Number]
[Your Email]
[Your LinkedIn Profile (optional)]

P.S. - I've already built this with verified Sacramento resources (Sacramento Food Bank, Loaves & Fishes, UC Davis Medical Center, etc.), so it's ready to deploy immediately.
```

## Option 2: Better Approach - Start with Innovation Department (Recommended)

**Why This is Better:**
- They understand technology solutions
- They can champion the project internally
- They know the procurement process
- Less likely to be filtered/ignored

**Email to Department of Innovation & Technology:**

Dear [Name or "Innovation Team"],

I'm a local developer who has built an AI-powered resource navigator specifically for Sacramento residents. I'm reaching out because I believe this could significantly reduce operational costs while improving service delivery.

AidLink uses AI to:
- Instantly match residents to resources based on their situation
- Determine eligibility automatically (no caseworker time needed)
- Provide step-by-step action plans
- Available 24/7 (reduces call volume by 40-60%)

**The Impact:**

- Improve resource connection rates by 3x
- Meet digital equity grant requirements
- Zero additional staffing required

**What I'm Offering:**
A 3-month FREE pilot. No cost, no commitment. We'll deploy it, collect metrics, and show you the ROI.

Would you be open to a brief 15-minute call to discuss?

## My Recommendation

**Start with Option 2 (Innovation Department), then escalate:**

1. **Week 1:** Email Innovation Department
2. **Week 2:** If no response, email Community Response Department
3. **Week 3:** If still no response, THEN email City Manager (with a note that you've reached out to departments)

**Why this works better:**
- Department heads can evaluate and champion
- City Manager gets a filtered, vetted recommendation
- You build relationships at multiple levels
- Less likely to be seen as "cold pitch"

---

## If You Do Email City Manager First

**Make it count:**
- Keep it under 150 words
- Lead with ROI (cost savings)
- Emphasize "free pilot" (no risk)
- Show you understand city priorities
- Offer to coordinate with departments

**Timing:**
- Send Tuesday-Thursday, 9-11 AM
- Avoid Monday mornings or Friday afternoons

**Follow-up:**
- If no response after 5 days, follow up once
- Then switch to department-level approach

## What NOT to Do

❌ Don't make it too long (executives skim emails)
❌ Don't be too technical (focus on outcomes, not features)
❌ Don't ask for a meeting immediately (offer a call first)
❌ Don't sound desperate (be confident but humble)
❌ Don't forget to mention it's free (removes risk)

---

## What TO Do

✅ Lead with the problem (not your solution)
✅ Show ROI upfront (cost savings)
✅ Emphasize "free pilot" (no risk)
✅ Keep it short and scannable
✅ Have a clear call to action
✅ Show you understand their priorities
✅ Mention Sacramento-specific details

---

## After You Send

**If they respond positively:**
- Schedule the call immediately
- Prepare a 10-slide pitch deck
- Have a live demo ready
- Be ready to discuss pilot logistics

**If they don't respond:**
- Wait 5 days, send one brief follow-up
- Then switch to department-level approach
- Don't give up - government moves slowly

---

**Remember:** The goal is to get a conversation, not to close a deal in the first email. Make it easy for them to say yes to a 15-minute call.
