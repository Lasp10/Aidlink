## Email Template (Customized for OIED)

**Subject:** AI Platform to Connect Residents with Community Resources - Free Pilot

```
Dear Office of Innovation and Economic Development Team,

I'm a local developer who has built a solution that directly aligns with your mission of "creating economic mobility and opportunity for all businesses and residents."

**The Challenge:**
Sacramento residents often struggle to find the right community resources (food, housing, healthcare, employment services), which creates barriers to economic mobility. Your "Community Resources and Financial Empowerment" program addresses this, but residents still face challenges navigating available resources efficiently.

**The Solution:**
I've built AidLink - an AI-powered platform that:
- Instantly matches residents to community resources based on their situation
- Determines eligibility for programs automatically (CalFresh, CalWORKs, Medi-Cal, etc.)
- Provides step-by-step action plans with phone numbers
- Connects residents with workforce development resources
- Available 24/7 (no additional staffing required)

**Why This Aligns with OIED's Goals:**
- Supports "Community Resources and Financial Empowerment" - helps residents access financial resources
- Enhances "Workforce Development" - connects residents with employment services
- Creates "economic opportunity" - removes barriers to accessing resources
- Improves "economic mobility" - helps residents find pathways to stability

**The Impact:**
- Reduce 211 call volume by 40-60% (saves city operational costs)
- Improve resource connection rates by 3x (better outcomes)
- Help residents access financial empowerment resources faster
- Connect more residents with workforce development opportunities
- Meet digital equity grant requirements (ARPA, CARES Act)

**What I'm Proposing:**
A 3-month FREE pilot program. No cost, no commitment. We'll deploy it, collect metrics, and show you the ROI and impact on economic mobility before you spend anything.

**Why I'm Reaching Out to OIED:**
This aligns perfectly with your "Community Resources and Financial Empowerment" and "Workforce Development" programs. I believe it could amplify your impact while reducing operational costs.

Would you be open to a brief 15-minute call to discuss how this could support OIED's mission?

Best regards,
[Your Full Name]
[Your Phone Number]
[Your Email]
[Your LinkedIn Profile (optional)]

P.S. - I've already built this with verified Sacramento resources (Sacramento Food Bank, Loaves & Fishes, UC Davis Medical Center, Sacramento County Department of Human Assistance, etc.), so it's ready to deploy immediately.
