# Pilot Program Strategy - Why Free? (Or Not?)

## Why Free Pilots Work for Government Sales

### The Problem with Government Sales:
- **Slow procurement process** (6-12 months)
- **Risk aversion** (they don't want to buy something that doesn't work)
- **Budget constraints** (even if they have money, they need justification)
- **Multiple stakeholders** (need to convince several people)

### How Free Pilots Solve This:
- **Removes risk** - They can try it without spending budget
- **Proves value** - You collect metrics to justify the purchase
- **Builds champions** - Users become internal advocates
- **Speeds up procurement** - They've already "approved" it through usage
- **Creates urgency** - Pilot ending creates deadline to purchase

## Your Options (Ranked)

### Option 1: Free Pilot (Recommended for First Customer)
**Pros:**
- Highest chance of getting a "yes"
- Removes all barriers
- Builds internal champions
- You collect valuable metrics
- Creates urgency when pilot ends

**Cons:**
- You work for free for 3 months
- No guaranteed revenue
- They might use it and not buy

**Best For:**
- First customer (proof of concept)
- Building credibility
- When you need a reference customer

**ROI Calculation:**
- 3 months free = $12,500 value (if annual is $50k)
- If they buy after pilot = $50k/year = 4x ROI on your "investment"
- If they don't buy, you still get:
  - Case study/data
  - Reference customer (even if unpaid)
  - Proof it works
  - Metrics for future sales

---

### Option 2: Paid Pilot (Reduce Risk for You)
**Pros:**
- You get paid immediately
- Shows they're serious
- Filters out tire-kickers

**Cons:**
- Harder to get "yes"
- Still requires procurement (might take months)
- Less urgency (they already paid)

**Pricing Options:**
- $5,000 for 3-month pilot (20% of annual)
- $10,000 for 3-month pilot (if annual is $50k)
- Pilot fee applies to first year if they purchase

**Best For:**
- When you have other customers
- When you need revenue now
- When you're confident in your product

---

### Option 3: No Pilot - Direct Sale
**Pros:**
- Full revenue immediately
- No free work
- Professional approach

**Cons:**
- Hardest to close (biggest barrier)
- Requires full procurement process
- Takes longest (6-12 months)
- No proof it works before purchase

**Best For:**
- When you have proven track record
- When you have other customers
- When they have urgent need
- When you have strong references

---

### Option 4: "Pilot Fee" That's Actually a Discount
**Pros:**
- You get paid
- They feel like they're getting a deal
- Creates commitment

**Example:**
- "First year: $35,000 (normally $50,000) - pilot pricing"
- "3-month pilot: $5,000, applies to first year if you purchase"

**Best For:**
- When you want commitment but reduce risk
- When you need some revenue upfront

---

## My Recommendation for Your Situation

### For First Customer (Sacramento):
**Use Option 1: Free Pilot**

**Why:**
1. **You need a reference customer** - Free pilot gets you one
2. **Government moves slowly** - Free pilot removes all barriers
3. **You need to prove it works** - Pilot gives you metrics
4. **Builds credibility** - "City of Sacramento uses this" is powerful

**The Math:**
- 3 months free = $12,500 value (if annual is $50k)
- If they buy after = $50k/year = You made $37,500 net
- Plus you get a reference customer (worth $50k+ in future sales)
- **Total value: $87,500+**

**If They Don't Buy:**
- You still get case study, metrics, proof it works
- You can use "City of Sacramento piloted this" in future pitches
- You learned what works/doesn't work

---

### For Second Customer (and beyond):
**Use Option 2 or 4: Paid Pilot or Discount**

**Why:**
- You now have proof it works (Sacramento)
- You can charge because you have credibility
- You need revenue to sustain business

---

## Alternative: Skip Pilot Entirely

### If You Want to Go Direct:

**Email Change:**
Instead of "3-month FREE pilot", say:

**Option A: "We can start with a 6-month pilot at 50% off"**
- $25,000 for 6 months (normally $50k/year = $25k for 6 months)
- But you call it "pilot pricing"
- They get discount, you get paid

**Option B: "First year special: $35,000 (normally $50,000)"**
- Call it "pioneer pricing" or "early adopter discount"
- You get paid, they feel like they're getting a deal

**Option C: "We can start with a 3-month trial at $5,000"**
- Low enough to be low-risk
- High enough that you get paid
- Applies to first year if they purchase

---

## What to Say Instead of "Free Pilot"

### If You Want to Charge:

**Email Line Change:**
Instead of:
> "A 3-month FREE pilot program. No cost, no commitment."

Say:
> "A 3-month pilot program at $5,000 (normally $12,500). This investment applies to your first year if you decide to proceed."

OR:

> "We can start with a 6-month pilot at $20,000 (pioneer pricing - normally $25,000). This gives you time to evaluate and prove ROI before committing to a full year."

OR:

> "First year special: $35,000 (normally $50,000). This includes full implementation, training, and support."

---

## The Psychology

### Why Free Works:
- **Removes all barriers** - Easiest to say yes
- **Creates reciprocity** - They feel obligated to buy
- **Builds trust** - You're confident enough to give it away
- **Proves value** - You're not hiding anything

### Why Charging Can Work:
- **Shows value** - If it's free, is it worth anything?
- **Creates commitment** - They're invested, so they'll use it
- **Filters serious buyers** - Only serious people pay
- **Professional** - You're a business, not a charity

---

## For Your Specific Situation

### Recommendation: Start with Free, Then Charge

**Sacramento (First Customer):**
- **Free 3-month pilot**
- Why: You need reference customer, proof it works, credibility

**Second City (After Sacramento):**
- **"Early Adopter Pricing: $35,000/year (normally $50,000)"**
- Why: You have proof it works, you need revenue

**Third City (and beyond):**
- **"Standard Pricing: $50,000/year"**
- Why: You're established, proven value

---

## What to Change in Your Email

### Option 1: Keep Free (Recommended for First)
Keep as-is, but add:
> "After the pilot, if you're satisfied, we can discuss annual licensing at $50,000/year."

### Option 2: Charge Reduced Fee
Change to:
> "A 3-month pilot program at $5,000 (pioneer pricing - normally $12,500). This investment applies to your first year if you decide to proceed."

### Option 3: Skip Pilot, Offer Discount
Change to:
> "First year special: $35,000 (normally $50,000) for early adopters. This includes full implementation, training, and support."

## The Bottom Line

**Free Pilot = Highest chance of getting first customer**
- You need Sacramento as a reference
- You need to prove it works
- You need credibility

**But you don't HAVE to do free:**
- You can charge $5k-10k for pilot
- You can skip pilot and offer discount
- You can go straight to full sale

**My take:** For your first customer (Sacramento), free pilot is worth it. For customers 2+, charge.
