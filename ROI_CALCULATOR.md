## 🧮 Basic ROI Calculation

### Step 1: Gather Current Costs

**211 Call Center Costs:**
- Average call volume per year: [Find this number]
- Average call duration: 10-15 minutes
- Cost per call: $5-10 (staff time + overhead)
- **Total annual cost: [Calculate]**

**Example:**
- 75,000 calls/year
- $7 per call
- **Total: $525,000/year**

### Step 2: Calculate Potential Savings

**Assumptions:**
- 40-60% call reduction (conservative estimate)
- Reduced call volume = fewer staff needed
- Overtime reduction

**Savings Calculation:**
```
Current Annual Cost: $525,000
Call Reduction: 40%
Calls Reduced: 30,000 calls
Cost Savings: $210,000/year
```

**Additional Savings:**
- Reduced overtime: $20,000/year
- Better resource utilization: $10,000/year (fewer wasted referrals)
- **Total Savings: $240,000/year**

### Step 3: Calculate Your Cost

**Your Pricing:**
- Annual License: $50,000
- Implementation: $10,000 (one-time)
- **Year 1: $60,000**
- **Year 2+: $50,000/year**

### Step 4: Calculate ROI

```
Net Savings = Total Savings - Your Cost
Net Savings = $240,000 - $50,000 = $190,000/year

ROI = (Net Savings / Your Cost) × 100
ROI = ($190,000 / $50,000) × 100 = 380%
```

**Present it as:**
- "For every $1 you spend, you save $3.80"
- "ROI of 380%"
- "Pays for itself in 2.5 months"

## 💬 Talking Points for ROI Discussion

**When they ask about cost:**
- "The question isn't whether you can afford this - it's whether you can afford NOT to have it."
- "This pays for itself in 3 months, then saves you $160k/year after that."
- "For every $1 you spend, you save $3-5."

**When they question the savings:**
- "We can prove this in the free pilot - you'll see the metrics before committing."
- "Even if we only achieve 30% reduction, you still save $107k/year."
- "The savings are conservative - we're only counting call volume reduction, not improved outcomes or grant compliance."

**When they say they don't have budget:**
- "That's why we're offering a free pilot - no budget needed."
- "After the pilot, if it works, we can discuss funding options (grants, existing budget, etc.)."
- "The ROI is so strong, you could fund this from the savings in the first year."
