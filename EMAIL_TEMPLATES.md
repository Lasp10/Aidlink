**Subject:** Reduce 211 Call Volume by 40% - AI Solution for Sacramento

```
Dear [Name],

I'm reaching out because I've built a solution that can help Sacramento residents find community resources faster while reducing costs for the city.

**The Challenge:**
Sacramento residents often struggle to find the right resources, leading to high 211 call volumes and long wait times. This creates frustration for residents and costs the city money.

**The Solution:**
AidLink is an AI-powered platform that:
- Instantly matches residents to resources based on their situation
- Determines eligibility automatically (no caseworker time needed)
- Provides step-by-step action plans with phone numbers
- Tracks outcomes for grant reporting
- Available 24/7 (reduces call volume by 40-60%)

**The Impact:**
- Save $50k-100k/year in call center costs
- Improve resource connection rates by 3x
- Meet digital equity grant requirements (ARPA, CARES Act)
- Better outcomes for residents

**What I'm Offering:**
A 3-month FREE pilot. No cost, no commitment. We'll deploy it, collect metrics, and show you the ROI before you spend anything.

Would you be open to a brief 15-minute call to discuss how this could help Sacramento residents?

Best regards,
[Your Name]
[Your Phone]
[Your Email]
[Demo Link: your-url-here]

P.S. - I've already built this with verified Sacramento resources (Sacramento Food Bank, Loaves & Fishes, UC Davis Medical Center, etc.), so it's ready to go.

## Follow-Up Email (Alternative Approach)

**Subject:** Free resource for Sacramento residents - no strings attached
